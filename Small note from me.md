Please note that the code here is according to the requirements of the questions provided in the assignments.

This is my first try at creating and maintaining a repository at github. Forgive any rookie mistakes.

Word of caution: Do not plagiarize and get yourself into trouble if my code fits your assignment requirements. Feel free to use it and understand it of course. 

Cheers!
